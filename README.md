# Price Bot

Simple bot/scraper in python to track some prices. This is for playing around only and NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE.

## Description

This "bot" (or rather web scraper) is quite straight forward. It fetches a product page (like amazon or similar) and tries to extract the product title as well as the current price. Running this daily via crontabs will allow us to create a price histogram. If you use this for your own purposes, be sure to NOT overload the target website and request their page as little as possible.
